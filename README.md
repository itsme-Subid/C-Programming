# C Basic Programs

The agenda of this repository is to help others and myself too.
I personally found it very useful for many times, generally I code a program but forget it very frequently, so this repository help by easy accessibility to my code and also easy to go through the programs.
 
## Installation GCC

Install GCC to Compile the C Programs

- Get the latest version of GCC via [tdm-gcc](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/), which provides up-to-date native builds of GCC, tdm-gcc, and other helpful C/C++ tools and libraries. You can download the latest installer from the tdm page or use this [link to the installer](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/).

- Follow the Installation instructions on the [tdm-gcc](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) website to install GCC. Take care to run actual tdm-gcc executable.

## Check your GCC installation
To check that your GCC tools are correctly installed and available, open a new Command Prompt and type:

```bash
g++ --version
gdb --version
```
> **Note**: If you don't see the expected output or g++ or gdb is not a recognized command. Make sure you followed the instructions on the [tdm-gcc website](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) to install GCC.
